Hello! I'Mahaveer, aexperienced computer vision engineer working at the intersection of research and product , for technologies such as Object detection & Recognition, 3D vision and SLAM. I graduated with Master's from Indian Institute of Information Technology & Management Gwalior (IIIT Gwalior), working with Prof. Rajendra Sahu (Director). Having worked on robust Object based SLAM and Monocular Object tracking . Previously, i worked at IIIT, Gwalior for an year as a Deep Learning Researcher. I worked on outdoor autonomous driving projects for moving object segmentation and localization.
